# OCP Java 8 study notes

---

These are some notes I've used for some training I've done preparing people to get this certification, also these notes are for myself (learning & getting that certification)


## How to read

These docs are in Markdown format, prepared to be used with the superb presentation software [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/)

If you need a PDF version you can use gitprint.com. Just change any link to my MD documents from github to gitprint.
