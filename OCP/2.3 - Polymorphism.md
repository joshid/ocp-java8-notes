## Polymorphism

- we can "see" only the part of the object we're interested in
- at runtime, if we call a method, the __true__ one is the method from the instance class, not the reference one

---

## Casting

- no need to cast if upcasting (from a specialzed version to a general one)
- need to cast if downcasting
- use `instanceof`
- can only cast inheritance-related classes

```java
String s = "";
Object o = s;
        
String s1 = (String) o;

```
